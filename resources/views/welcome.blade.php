        <p>We're a growing <a class="text-red-600" href="https://www.meetup.com/Werewolf-the-Social-Deduction-game-Bristol/">Meetup</a> community that plays a social deduction game called Werewolf ("Wherewolf") together. </p>
        <p>The group has been around for around 6 years at this point and has around 1500 members! </p>
        <p>In normal times, we host around 4 sessions a month, generally on alternating Tuesdays and Sundays.</p>
        <p>New members are welcome and will be required to RSVP on Meetup to one of our upcoming "First Timer Friendly" events.</p>
        <p>Please note, we arrange all events via <a class="text-red-600" href="https://www.meetup.com/Werewolf-the-Social-Deduction-game-Bristol/">Meetup</a>, so please sign up there to get a spot at an event!</p>
