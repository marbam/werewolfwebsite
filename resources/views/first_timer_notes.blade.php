        <h2 class="text-xl pt-4">Arrival</h2>
        <ul class="pt-2 list-disc pl-4">
            <li>When you arrive at any of our Werewolf events, seek out the hosts. They'll make themselves as obvious as possible. They'll hand you a name tag, and direct you to a place in the venue where you'll be playing.</li>
            <li>Be prompt! If the event time says it starts at 6:30, and you show up late, please be aware we'll probably ask you to sit out of the first game of the evening. It's not fair to make everyone wait for people who arrive late.</li>
            <li>In a similar vein, if you're running late, please keep us notified by posting in the event. If we know you're going to be late, we might be able to hold fire on starting for a few minutes.</p>
            <li>Generally we'll play a few games in an evening, with everyone having the option to play at least a couple of games. You're welcome to leave at any point in the session although we'd prefer it if you'd finish your game for everyone else's benefit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-xl pt-4">General Pointers</h2>
        <ul class="pt-2 list-disc pl-4">
            <li>It's always a slightly awkward situation to be in as a first timer. Based on this we always group first timers together, and will have an experienced moderator (or two) around to guide everyone through the game.</li>
            <li>We talk about 'roles' throughout the game - Please note this just refers to which side you're on in the game and what information/abilities you have - It's a game of logic/bluffying and there's no role playing involved.</li>
            <li>The first rule of Werewolf is to never take things personally. At some point in their first few games everyone will have a reason to lie/bluff regardless of whether they're a good or bad role. It's crucial that we all keep in mind that it is just a game. If the village don't believe you when you're telling the truth it just means the wolves are doing well! When the game ends, we drop all grudges and move onto the next one. Your worst enemy in the last game could be the reason you win the next game!</li>
            <li>Whilst asking that people don't take things personally, we also note that it's a safe social space. If you're derogatory or offensive to other attendees, we may ask you to leave and ban you from future events.</li>
            <li>You'll see we do more advanced sessions - We ask that you try out a good number of games before signing up to an Intermediate session where we'll slowly start adding in extra roles/modifiers. It's important that you're familiar with the base game before you start on the Intermediate stuff.</ul>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-xl pt-4">Signing up and Cancelling</h2>
        <ul class="pt-2 list-disc pl-4">
            <li>All of our public-facing events are organised via Meetup. You'll need to sign up for an event there. If it's full, you'll be added to the waitlist.</li>
            <li>If you're on the waitlist or haven't signed up, please don't attend! We have a limited amount of space available so if you're not officially signed up, we'll have to send you home.</li>
            <li>We ask you to only sign up if you can definitely attend, and if you do need to cancel, please do so with the maximum amount of notice. Our events can have large waitlists so I'm sure you'll appreciate that cancelling within a few hours of the event's start doesn't help anyone.</li>
            <li>We also appreciate that Meetup isn't brilliant at notifying people when they've been promoted to GOING from the Waitlist, so please remember to check throughout the day.</li>
        </ul>
