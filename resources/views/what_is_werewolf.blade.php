        <h1 class="text-2xl">What is a Social Deduction game?</h1>
        <p>Werewolf is a type of social deduction game, and it's probably best to start by explaining what that is!</p>
        <p>A Social Deduction game involves getting a group of people together - ideally in person although online works to a limited degree!</p>
        <p>Everyone in the group is then given a "Role" for the game, which in turn may give them information about other players or abilities to use throughout the game.</p>
        <p>Players then need to use their information/abilities to identify their allies and enemies throughout the course of the game, and eliminate the opposition to win the game.</p>

        <h2 class="pt-4 text-xl">What is Werewolf?</h2>
        <p>There are countless variations of Werewolf out there, and you'll have probably encountered some of them in the past, examples including:</p>
        <ul class="pl-4">
            <li class="list-disc">Mafia</li>
            <li class="list-disc">One Night Werewolf</li>
            <li class="list-disc">Werewolves of Millers Hollow</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pt-2">In our group we play a very specific version from Italy created by Christian ((name)). It's proven quite popular, with four Meetup groups now dedicated to it throughout the UK, including London, Oxford and Brighton. Between the four groups we're up to almost 5,000 members!</p>
        <p class="pt-2">In it's simplest form, everyone is given a role which will divide you into two groups - Villagers and Wolves. The goal of the game is to eliminate the other team by deducing and bluffing your way to victory</p>
        <p>Different roles in the game are given different information or abilities that will allow them to figure out who is on their team. Wolves on the other hand are able to attack another player every night and eliminate them from the game.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">It's not a game for everyone, but it is a great way to meet people. It acts a brilliant icebreaker with people bonding over the game instead of having to make awkward small talk.</p>
        <p class="pt-2">You may have played other, similar versions before, but if you're attending one of our Werewolf sessions for the first time, we ask everyone to attend a First Timer Friendly session to start with. </p>
        <p>We get the occasional person signing up assuming they'll be able to waltz into an intermediate session because they've played a different version before. Unfortunately this is rarely the case, so everyone is required to jump onto one of our dedicated FTF sessions to start with. Check out our <a href="/upcoming">Upcoming Sessions</a> page for more info.</p>

        <p class="pt-2">Our events have historically been really popular, with up to 40 people signing up to events (split between 3 games!) so we advise you to book early. Our events are all hosted via Meetup so you'll need to sign up to an event on there.</p>
        <p>We also limit our RSVP's so that they open a couple of weeks before the actual event. This in turn stops people signing up months in advance and forgetting to attend!</p>
