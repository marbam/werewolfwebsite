        <h1 class="text-2xl">Suitable for First Timers</h1>
        <p>There are a lot of different variations of Werewolf out there. We host regular "First Timer Friendly" sessions which are specifically designed for new members to get to grips with the basics of our version.</p>
        <p>These events include a ~15 minute introduction to the concepts and etiquette so if you want to play a game, we require everyone to get the introduction.</p>
        <p>We also run relatively regular non-Werewolf events. Everyone is welcome at these, regardless of whether or not you've attended one of our sessions before.</p>
